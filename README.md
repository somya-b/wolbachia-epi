Efficacy of Wolbachia-mediated sterility to suppress dengue: a synthetic control study

Singapore, a tropical and urbanized city state, is highly vulnerable to dengue outbreaks due to a multitude of factors, including a year-round conducive climate for Aedes mosquito breeding and a dense, urban human population. In the absence of effective therapeutics, vector control remains the key approach to prevention. We examine the potential of Wolbachia-mediated incompatible insect technique coupled with sterile insect technique for strengthening vector control and reducing dengue incidence in Singapore. Extensive field trials were conducted in four regions of Singapore, starting in 2018. We develop a synthetic control study framework to investigate the effectiveness of releasing Wolbachia-infected male Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in reducing dengue incidence in the four trial sites from 2014 to 2022. We provide the first critical evidence that releasing Wolbachia-infected male Ae. aegypti mosquitoes can stem dengue transmission using large-scale field trial data.
